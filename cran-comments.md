Initial submission of cRowflow (version 1.0.0).

This package provides functions for assessing clustering stability through repeated stochastic clustering. It is compatible with any clustering algorithm that outputs labels or returns results containing cluster assignments.
All functions have been tested and the package passes checks. There are no known issues at this time.

Thank you for reviewing this submission.
